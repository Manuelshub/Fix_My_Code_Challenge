# Fix_My_Code_Challenge

## Introduction

Fix my code is a new type of project where we'll jump into existing code base and fix it!
Sometimes you will know the language, sometimes not. This project aims to improve your coding skills by providing you with broken or poorly written code snippets that you need to fix or refactor. It's a fun and educational way to learn about common programming mistakes and best practices.
